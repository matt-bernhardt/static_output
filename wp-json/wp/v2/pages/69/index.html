This session will walk you through the dos and don&#8217;ts associated with research data and artifacts, all of those associated bits of information necessary to understand research data. These can include structured data, images, unstructured data, metadata, analysis scripts, analysis environment, code books, data dictionaries, computational workflows, models, algorithms, Jupyter notebooks, code libraries, etc. We&#8217;ll cover the tools and resources available to you for making decisions about your research data (and associated bits) with regard to use agreements, security requirements, and copyright and licensing. We will also explore some case studies for some practical applications exercise. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/0m4qm5t9wjwnq6t\/TLO_DoRightByYourResearchData_Slides_MIT.pdf?dl=0\">Slides from the latest Research Data Rights, Responsibilities, and Licenses (pdf)<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Managing Your Research Code<\/strong><br \/>\nDo you write software? Have you been required by funders or publishers to share your code, or do you want to make it accessible to others to use? Documenting, sharing and archiving your research software can make your research more transparent and reproducible, and can help you get credit for your work. This workshop reviews reasons to share your software, best practices and considerations for documenting your software and making it citable, and options for archiving and publishing research software, including software papers and managing software with associated data sets, and some best practices for citing and documenting all of the software that you use. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/gukkthqzcuea1kr\/MgingCode_Slides_MIT.pdf?dl=0\">Slides from the latest Managing Your Research Code workshop (pdf)<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"\/calendar\">See a schedule of upcoming workshops.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The MIT Libraries run various workshops to help you gain new skills in research data management, including: Quick &amp; dirty data management: the 5 things you should absolutely be doing with your data now Do you have data?
